This project began as the ZEROFAIL fork of ``mogwai``, a [TinkerPop3](https://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/) [Gremlin Server](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.1.1-incubating/reference/#gremlin-server) compatible port of Cody Lee's original Python object graph mapper for Titan 0.5.x. 

As Gremlin approached The TinkerPop, ``mogwai`` felt left behind and the closer he got, the more his world dissolved. He realized that all that he realized was just a realization and that all realized realizations are just as real as the need to evolve into something else - ``goblin`` was born...

``Goblin`` uses @davebshow [gremlinclient](https://github.com/davebshow/gremlinclient) for asynchronous websocket based communication with the Gremlin Server, and is therefore designed to be multi-platform, allowing the user to choose between [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), [Trollius](http://trollius.readthedocs.org/), or [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). It aims to provide full support for all TinkerPop3 enabled graph databases; however, it is currently only tested against [Titan:db 1.x](http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/1.0.0/index.html). This fork is under active development.

### Example Usage:

Download Titan, unzip, and fire it up:

```sh
$ wget http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/downloads/titan/titan-1.0.0-hadoop1.zip
$ unzip titan-1.0.0-hadoop1.zip
$ cd titan-1.0.0-hadoop1/
$ ./bin/titan.sh start
```

The following example uses Python 3.5. On Ubuntu, you can install Python 3.5 using deadsnakes:

```sh
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.5
```

Then, if you have virtualenvwrapper, you can do something like this:

```sh
$ mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 goblin
$ pip install git+https://github.com/ZEROFAIL/goblin.git@master
```


Then you are ready to go. Goblin is easy to use, and while it's not yet feature complete, it's already working pretty well:
